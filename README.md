# Ranitidine Shortages

In October 2019 the Department of Health and Social Care issued a [Supply Disruption Alert](https://www.cas.mhra.gov.uk/ViewandAcknowledgment/ViewAttachment.aspx?Attachment_id=103298) advising that _all oral formulations of ranitidine are anticipated to be out of stock, with no date for resupply until further notice_. They advised that there are two possible options for managing patient's conditions 

1. Review to establish if ongoing treatment is still required. 
2. If ongoing treatment is still required, then consider switching to an alternative treatment (see
table below).

We therefore set out to investigate which option prescribers and patients chose.



# EBM DataLab's skeleton notebook environment

![status](https://github.com/ebmdatalab/custom-docker/workflows/Notebook%20checks/badge.svg)

## Getting started with this skeleton project

This is a skeleton project for creating a reproducible, cross-platform
analysis notebook, using Docker.  It also includes:

* configuration for `jupytext`, to support easier code review
* cross-platform startup scripts
* best practice folder structure and documentation

Developers and analysts using this skeleton for new development should
refer to [`DEVELOPERS.md`](DEVELOPERS.md) for instructions on getting
started.  Update this `README.md` so it is a suitable introduction to
your project.

## How to view the notebooks

Notebooks live in the `notebooks/` folder (with an `ipynb`
extension). You can most easily view them [on
nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ebmdatalab/seb-docker-test/tree/master/notebooks/),
though looking at them in Github should also work.

To do development work, you'll need to set up a local jupyter server
and git repository - see `DEVELOPERS.md` for more detail.
